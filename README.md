## Stock Screener

This app implements a few tools I normally use to find stocks. 

1. Performance evaluation: Select a ticker and get performance metrics in a table as output.
2. Screener: Run a set of predefined screeners. It allows filtering the results using the available columns also. 
3. Stop Loss: It helps define a stop-loss based on volatility using the ATR indicator. 

## Installation

1. Download the repository and unzip it. 
2. Install R
3. Install R packages needed for the app. See global.R
4. Run the script: jobs/get_historical_prices.R 
This downloads the data the app needs to work faster. It will save a file in data/prices.rds
5. Open in RStudio and click Run App. 

## Data

I'll add scripts in order to update the price data.
